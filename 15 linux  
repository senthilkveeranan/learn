What is the purpose of having different network ports?
Let say you have server A with 2 service running on it 
1) DNS service 
2) NFS service 
Now if you want to communicate with the server yes we can connetc with server IP , but we can not 
communicate all the services running  on the server with the same server IP , Thats why we need different ports .
            So when you want to communicate with the server and you wnat to talk to the DNS service , then the DNS serice have its own dedicated ports , that port is 53 

            same way if we want to communicate with the NFS service on the same server then we can use server IP along with  NFS port (2049)
Thasts why we are having different port in one server and its use.
