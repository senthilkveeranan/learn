1) What is the purpose of having different network ports?
Let say you have server A with 2 service running on it 
1) DNS service 
2) NFS service 
Now if you want to communicate with the server yes we can connetc with server IP , but we can not 
communicate all the services running  on the server with the same server IP , Thats why we need different ports .
            So when you want to communicate with the server and you wnat to talk to the DNS service , then the DNS serice have its own dedicated ports , that port is 53 

            same way if we want to communicate with the NFS service on the same server then we can use server IP along with  NFS port (2049)
Thasts why we are having different port in one server and its use.


2) What are the fields in /etc/passwd?
Every time we create a user the user information will be saved in /etc/passwd file 
=================================
1 field stars with username
2 field x - means passwd but the password is not there , bcs passwd is in /etc/shadow in enrepted format
3 field is userid 
4 field is group id 
5 field is user description
6 field is for Home directory 
7 field is for shell , user's default shell entry 
=================================

3) explain the cronjob syntax? if the cron job is not run how  you trubleshoot ?
Inorder to run the cronjob we need to run # crontab -e (-e for edit)
Once we run it will open a kind of vi or vim editor 
=================================
First field - minites
secound field - Hour
Third field - Day of the month
Fourh field - month 
fith field - day of the week  
=================================
Troubleshoot:
============= we need to cheek the cronjob logs /var/log/cron & /var/log/messages
we can actually check our mail as well             
sometime user did some mistakes in syntax of cron , which also leads some failure 
what is goin to executable also matters in cron , we need to check on that we well .

Linux Boot process :
====================
* The systemd is the new service manager in Cent 
* Systemd is backward compatiable sicne it runs init script/command also works
* Every system administrarot needs to understand the boot process of an OS in order to troubleshoot     more effectively, suppose if the sysem doesn't boot 

As soon as we power on the machine/server it actually has firmware in it (That firmware not actually releated with Operating system) actually comes with manufacture, its preinstalled on it , That firmware is called BIOS (Basic Input and Output settins) ..it takes up and goed to the POST process 
POST proces is power on self test it checks all the hardware attached to the system , if all are OK Then 

MBR (Master boot Record) is loaded, This information is saved in the first sector of the har disk 
which indicates where the GRUB2 is located , it can be loaded into computer RAM. 

GRUB2 (Grand Unified Boot loader), Basically the GRUB2 jobs is load the Linux kernel , that information is in /boot , /grub2, /grup2.cfg which is the config file , which loads all required files and drivers from initrd.img file and its starts the very first OS Operating system procss that is called "systemd"
this is the first process that system starts up by default its given the process id "1"
systemd starts other required process we well  

And it reaches /etc/systemd target file this to bring the system to the run level , total which has 7 run levels 0 - 6 .  all run levels are defined in /etc/systemd/default.target file and system get into Login prompt
