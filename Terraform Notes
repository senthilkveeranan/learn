How to create aws resource example like s3 bucket in terraform ?
s3=Amazon simple storage service 
s3=provides high durability S3=99.Nine9s , very very less change to loose the data
We can store and retrive any amount of data at any time, from anyware on the web.

In teraform :
        whenever we want to do in terraform we need to use 'resource'
To create this s3 resource we need to provide two important message
1) what is the type of the resource - s3_bucket - in terraform all the aws resource starts with aws_s3_bucket(iclude the cloud provier name)

2) Secound type is internel name for aws and terraform communication 
    resource =  "aws_s3_bucket"  "my_s3_bucket" {
        bucket = "my-s3-bucket-nalliveera1-senthil-001"    -> specific name it should be unique...for our indntification
    }
Next : In terraform we have two step approch 
1) plan - (plan will tell us what will happened if we execute this file) # terraform plan
2) execute - Actual execution # terraform apply 

Note: Once we executed this terraform apply sucessfully , it will create one file  "terraformstatetf"
DESIRED  --- KNOWN ---   ACTUAL
DESIRED -- What you want 
KNOWN --- The result of previouse execution ..what is present in the tfstage file is known state
ACTUAL --- What is actually present now in aws-cloud is actual state (Now you tried to do some changes ..so what is present state now , whether it modified or replaced or not)               

To vies all the details of my bucket which i have created?

# aws_s3_bucket.my-s3-bucket
provier_resource_type.resource name

create an IAM user via terraform:
=================================

   resource =  "aws_iam_user"  "my_iam_user" {
        bucket = "my-iam-user-abc" 
    }
