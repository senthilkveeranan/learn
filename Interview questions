what are the issues you faced and resolved during your sonar, maven pipleline in jenkins ?


What is the use of pipeline you guys are using in your project ?
Pipeline script is what why needed?
Pipeline script is another way of Job configuration with the help of code 
advantanges: 
            1) we can devide the job into different stages(build/test/Depoly) and each part can run on each agent 
            2) parrallel execution of stages are easy configure so that we can save time
            3) Each stage can execute with different version of JDK/MVN Versions
            4) If any stage is faild we can restart the state alone instead of doing from bengining
            5) We can visuvalize the stage in jenkins dashboard
            6) Build can hold for user input (approvels..like that)
            7) we can do the Version control of code , if the code fails we can easily revert the old stage 
            8) Pause, and restart the Build
            9) In multibranch pipeline scripts will automatically creates in sub-branches   
what are the different types of pipeline script? and difference between them?
Type:
=====
1)Declarative 2) Pipeline 
* Difference between Declarative and pipeline:
    Declarative pipline is recent addition to the jenkins
    Declarative is very easy when compared with Scripted 
    Declarative allways starts with "pipeline" whereas 
    scripted pipeline starts with the keyword called "node"

AGENT  --> SRAGES  --> STAGE  -->  STEPS 


Variables:
===========
1) pre defined 
https://<ipaddress>:8080/env-vars.html --> we can get the predefined varaibles 

2) user defined
